# StudioFlow - Project Status & Overview

## Project Vision
StudioFlow is a web-based tool for visually designing audio studios, aimed at music producers, engineers, and hobbyists. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for arranging physical audio gear (like racks, mixers, desks, and speakers) in a 2D room layout. Inspired by tools like Figma, IKEA's room planner, and Reason's visual cabling.

## Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.19 with React plugin (downgraded for Node.js 18 compatibility)
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4.0
- **2D Graphics**: SVG-based rendering with coordinate transformation
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js 0.157.0 (available but not yet implemented)
- **UI Library**: Mantine 8.2.1 (core + hooks)
- **Utilities**: UUID generation for unique IDs, ESLint for code quality

## Completed Features

### 1. Model-View Architecture ✅ COMPLETED
- **Unified Data Store**: Single `studioStore` replacing separate library/diagram stores
- **StudioItem** type combining library templates with instance data
- **LibraryItem** templates separate from studio instances
- **Single Source of Truth**: All project data in one place for multiple view types
- **Extensible Design**: Ready for BOM view, project save/load, and additional features

### 2. Core Type System ✅ COMPLETED
- **StudioItem** interface with library data + instance properties (position, canvas state)
- **LibraryItem** templates with dimensions, connections, categories
- **Connection** type for input/output ports with grouping
- **Viewport** interface for canvas pan/zoom state
- Fully typed with TypeScript throughout

### 3. Library Panel ✅ COMPLETED
- Searchable gear library using Mantine components
- Professional UI with Paper containers, shadows, proper spacing
- Split layout: gear list (top) + selected item properties (bottom)
- Sample gear data: Studio Monitors, Audio Interface, Synthesizer, Mixing Console
- Real-time filtering by name/category
- Selection highlighting and drag-to-canvas functionality

### 4. Interactive Canvas ✅ COMPLETED
- **SVG-based 2D Canvas**: Precise coordinate system with world/screen transformation
- **Pan & Zoom**: Mouse drag to pan, wheel to zoom (10-200x range)
- **Grid System**: 0.5m grid for precise gear placement
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Seamless drag from library to canvas with accurate positioning
- **Item Selection**: Click to select/deselect with visual highlighting
- **Item Movement**: Drag selected items to reposition on canvas
- **Collision Detection**: Precise click detection using gear dimensions

### 5. Development Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- Mantine UI library fully configured with provider and CSS
- ESLint and TypeScript strict configuration with no errors
- Build and development scripts working perfectly
- WSL-compatible development with Vite polling
- Type-only imports configured for verbatimModuleSyntax

## Sample Data
Currently includes 4 sample gear items with actual product images:
1. **Genelec 1031A** (0.3×0.5m) - XLR/TRS inputs
2. **MOTU 828** (0.4×0.2m) - 2 mic inputs, stereo outputs, headphone out
3. **Roland JP-8000** (1.2×0.4m) - Stereo audio + MIDI I/O
4. **Yamaha O2R** (1.8×0.8m) - 4 channel inputs, main stereo out

All items now display actual product photos in the properties panel for professional presentation.

## Architecture Highlights

### Model-View Pattern
- **Model**: `studioStore` holds all project data (library templates + studio instances)
- **Views**: Components filter data as needed (`getCanvasItems()`, `getAllStudioItems()`)
- **Future-Ready**: Easy to add BOM view, connections view, project management
- **Clean Separation**: Library templates vs studio instances with proper relationships

### Data Flow
1. **Library Templates** → User drags from library
2. **Studio Instances** → Created with position, canvas state, unique IDs
3. **Canvas View** → Shows `isOnCanvas: true` items
4. **Future BOM View** → Shows all studio items regardless of canvas placement

## Product Vision Alignment

### Current Gap Analysis (vs `/plan/product_overview.txt`)
✅ **Completed**: Drag gear into room layout with professional UI
